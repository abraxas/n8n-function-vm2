# n8n-function-vm2

**n8n** `2.42.0` - n8n GmbH

[GHSA-j4p8-h8mh-rh8q](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-j4p8-h8mh-rh8q) moved **`n8n-nodes-base.code`** onto the JS task-runner child. Production spawn adds `--disallow-code-generation-from-strings` and `--disable-proto=delete`. The leftover is the nodes they hid instead of moving. [`Function.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/n8n%402.42.0/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Function/Function.node.ts) is `hidden: true`. So is FunctionItem. So is LangChain Code. Palette hide is a UI flag. Workflow JSON save/import still resolves the type. Default `NODES_EXCLUDE` is only Execute Command and Local File Trigger. The execute path is in-process **vm2** `NodeVM` 3.12.2 in the n8n main process.

**A default member who can create a workflow can run JS in the n8n main process. Hidden is not an ACL.**

## What an attacker can do

As a default member, import or create a workflow whose node `type` is `n8n-nodes-base.function` (or `functionItem`, or `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.code`) and execute it. The JS runs **in the n8n main process**.

That is host RCE as the n8n UID: instance secrets, other users' credential ciphertext on disk, the DB. Multi-tenant member to instance takeover. Not OS LPE. Not unauthenticated. Code v2 on the same instance does not see `process` that way.

Same product, sibling leftover: [Databricks path join](https://github.com/abraxas/n8n-databricks-path-join).

## How I found it

I read the 16 September 2026 GHSA wave first, then ten hunts on tag **n8n@2.42.0**. Expression sandbox, Code/Function/vm2, credentials, webhooks, HTTP/SSRF, Git node, community packages, auth/SSO, node injection, public API. Most of the Highs in that wave are closed on this pin. Code was not finished.

v3 breaking-change rules already mark Function / FunctionItem **removed**. On 2.42.0 they are leftover, not an intended long-term sandbox. Function also injects `this.helpers`, including helpers the JS runner lists as unsupported. I did not need a public vm2 gadget to prove the process boundary.

I stood up stock `n8nio/n8n:2.42.0`, signed up a **member** (not instance owner), imported `n8n-nodes-base.function`, executed it. Function `pid=7` is the n8n main PID. Same JS in Code v2: `hasProcess: false`. Task-runner child is pid 26. Witness `N8N-FUNCTION-VM2-WITNESS`.

Wrong turns already recorded: Function type rejected as hidden/unknown (then the node is actually excluded); Function pid equal to the task-runner child (then it already moved); Code v2 seeing `process` (then the runner is not the control); a vm2 exploit gadget, a reverse shell, OS LPE. Theatre. The witness is main PID vs `hasProcess: false`.

## Lab

```bash
cd lab
./run.sh
```

Target **only** `http://127.0.0.1:18201`. Default `NODES_EXCLUDE`. Attacker is a member.

```text
authenticated-as=member
function-fields pid=7 witness=N8N-FUNCTION-VM2-WITNESS
code-fields hasProcess=False pid=None
compare function_pid=7 code_pid=None main_pid=7 runner_pid=26 who=member
SUCCESS N8N-FUNCTION-VM2 who=member function_pid=7 code_pid=None main_pid=7 runner_pid=26 N8N-FUNCTION-VM2-WITNESS
```

## The fix

Add `n8n-nodes-base.function`, `n8n-nodes-base.functionItem`, and `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.code` to default `NODES_EXCLUDE`, or route them through `JsTaskRunnerSandbox` the way Code v2 already does. Palette `hidden` is not enough.
